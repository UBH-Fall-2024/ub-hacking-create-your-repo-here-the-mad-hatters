We suggest running the program on multiple laptops as it is intended to be multiplayer
Choose a device to be your server host
That device will run the server file to host the game

2 other people will be the players
First they must go into the client class and find the SERVER_ADDRESS variable
private static final String SERVER_ADDRESS = "127.0.0.1";
"127.0.0.1" is the local host, use this if you plan to run all the games on the same laptop as the server
Otherwise, replace this with the IPV4 Address of the hosts laptop/device
If you need help lookup how to find your IPV4
Both players need to have the hosts IPV4 as the SERVER_ADDRESS;
  private static final String SERVER_ADDRESS = "HOSTS_IPV4";

Once the SERVER_ADDRESS is set up, we can begin running
First the host runs the server file
Once the host is running the server file, the 2 players run the file "main.java"
This should open the game for the 2 players starting on the title screen

The 2 players should press start, the order they join will determine if they're player 1 or 2
  1st to press start is player 1, 2nd is player 2
pressing start connects the player to the host
once both players are connected game pieces can begin moving

Each player will have 4 buttons on the bottom labeled with a character from alice in wonderland
  player 1 has good characters like Alice
  player 2 had evil characters like the Red Queen
Pressing these buttons will spawn the named character in front of your tower
the character will move towards the opponents tower and upon reaching it hit the tower and die
if a character encounters one of your opponenets characters along the way, they will fight

the goal is to take the other players tower down to 0 health
each button has a cooldown determined by the strength of the summon
the summons in order are scout, ranged, warrior, tank
feel free to view the underlying stats in the character file

Have Fun!!! Enjoy!!!
