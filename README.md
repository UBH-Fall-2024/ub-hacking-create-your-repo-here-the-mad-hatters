# Multiplayer Game Setup Guide

## Overview
This game is designed to be played multiplayer. To get started, you'll need to run the program on multiple devicesâ€”one will act as the **server host**, and the other two will be the **players**.

### Server Setup
1. **Choose a device to be your server host**.
2. The host device will need to run the **server file** to start hosting the game.

### Client Setup (Players)
1. **Players need to set the `SERVER_ADDRESS` variable** in the `Client` class. 
   - The default address is `127.0.0.1`, which is the local host address. Use this if you are running the game entirely on the same laptop.
   - If the server is on a different device, **replace** `127.0.0.1` with the **IPv4 address** of the host device.
     - **Example**: `private static final String SERVER_ADDRESS = "HOSTS_IPV4";`
     - If you're unsure how to find the host's IPv4 address, you can search for instructions on how to find it for your operating system.

### Starting the Game
1. **Run the server file on the host device**.
2. Once the server is running, the **two players** should run the `main.java` file on their devices. 
   - This will open the game, and both players will see the title screen.

### Gameplay
1. On the title screen, both players should press "Start" to begin the game.
   - The first player to press "Start" will be **Player 1**, and the second player to press "Start" will be **Player 2**.
   - Pressing "Start" will connect each player to the host server.
   
2. After both players are connected, the game will begin, and the players will see their respective game pieces.
   - Players have 4 buttons at the bottom of the screen, each representing a character from *Alice in Wonderland*.
   - **Player 1** controls **good characters** like Alice.
   - **Player 2** controls **evil characters** like the Red Queen.
   - Pressing a button will spawn the corresponding character in front of your tower.
   
3. The characters will automatically move towards the opponent's tower and attempt to deal damage upon reaching it.
   - If a character encounters an opposing character during its journey, they will engage in a fight.
   
4. The goal of the game is to **reduce your opponent's tower health to 0**.

### Character Summons
Each player can summon characters by pressing the buttons. The available summons are:
- **Scout**: A light, fast character.
- **Ranged**: A character that can attack from a distance.
- **Warrior**: A balanced character with both offense and defense.
- **Tank**: A heavy character with high defense but slower movement.

- Each button has a **cooldown** based on the strength of the summon.
- Feel free to inspect the underlying stats for each character in the character class file.
